# Setup

After downloading via `git clone git@github.com:federatedcloud/DouglasMetabolicModels.git`,
go into the directory and run `git lfs install` (only once per repo) and `git lfs pull`
to pull in models and other data files.

Run `initDMM` from this (top-level directory). This will
add paths to the environment.

Afterward, you still need to run `initCobraToolbox` from your `cobratoolbox` directory.
