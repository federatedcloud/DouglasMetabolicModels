The data generated here relies on the `competitionIndices` function.

It has the following header:  `Met, CompIdx, InfluxIdx, OutfluxIdx, FluxInfo`.

1. `Met` - The metabolite involved.
1. `CompIdx` - The net competition = `CompIdx` = `InfluxIdx` - `OutfluxIdx`.
1. `FluxInfo` - Per-species flux data associated with `Met`.
