## Heatmap tables

The heatmap tables show fluxes for particular reactions (rows) grouped by
pathways, and organized into columns according to which species and community
the flux occurs in. There are two tables, `heatmap_exchange.csv` for exchange
fluxes, and similarly, `heatmap_trans.csv` for intracellular exchange fluxes.
for Note that for the exchange flux table, the exchange fluxes are with the host
organism (environment), so **they are the same** for each species within a
community.
